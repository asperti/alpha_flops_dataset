# alpha_flops_dataset
A dataset comparing flops and execution time for different NN layers

This repository contains the data used in the article "Dissecting FLOPs along input dimensions for GreenAI cost estimations", accepted for presentation at the 7th International Conference on Machine Learning, Optimization and Data Science (LOD 2021), October 4 – 8, 2021 Grasmere, Lake District, England – UK. It is a joint work between me, Davide Evangelista and Moreno Marzolla.

The dataset is organized in "PLOTS", in order to allow a simple generation of relevant diagrams. The plots correspond to the figures in the article.
